Version 3.2 (2012-05-06)
------------------------
Tiny changes to accommodate changes introduced in lsqfit 4.2:

- svdcut and svdnum can be 2-tuples now.

- GPrior replaced by gvar.BufferDict

- removed module dataset as it is no longer needed by corrfitter, which now
  uses gvar.Dataset and gvar.avg_data instead. A simplified replacement for
  the old module is included (called dataset.py) for use with old code. It is
  not installed by 'make install'; it can be installed if needed (for old
  code) using, for example, "python dataset-setup.py install --user". Don't
  install it if you don't have old code.
