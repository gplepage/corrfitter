corrfitter
----------

This directory contains code for manipulating correlators and other Monte
Carlo 'data' (eg, as in lattice QCD). The main module is:

corrfitter.py - Defines class CorrFitter for fitting the t dependence of 
		2 and 3 point correlators, described by Corr2 and Corr3 respectively.
	
Information on how to install the library is in the file INSTALLATION.

Documentation on how to use this module is in doc/html/index.html (html
version, which is the better one) and doc/corrfitter.pdf (pdf version, for 
printing).

To test the module try 'make test-all'. (These are not great tests because
roundoff error can cause small changes to occur on different hardware,
causing some tests to fail. So it is not uncommon for some of the tests to
fail even if everything is alright --- the answers that come out will be
close to the ones in the .out file.)

The test files (.py files) in tests/ are also examples of how to use 
corrfitter. See the tests/README for more information.

This module requires the lsqfit and gvar python packages.
