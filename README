corrfitter
----------

This directory contains code for manipulating correlators and other Monte
Carlo 'data' (eg, as in lattice QCD). The main module is:

corrfitter.py - Defines class CorrFitter for fitting the t dependence of 
		2 and 3 point correlators, described by Corr2 and Corr3 respectively.
	
Information on how to install the library is in the file INSTALLATION.

Documentation on how to use this module is in doc/html/index.html (html
version, which is the better one) and doc/corrfitter.pdf (pdf version, for 
printing).

To test the module try 'make tests'. 

The .py files in directory examples/ illustrate how to use corrfitter. See
the file examples/README for more information.

This module requires the lsqfit and gvar python packages.

Background information on the some of the fitting strategies used by
corrfitter can be found by doing a web search for "hep-lat/0110175" and
"arXiv:1111.1363". These are two papers by G.P. Lepage and collaborators 
whose published versions are: G.P. Lepage et al, Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 
106 (2002) 12-20; and K. Hornbostel et al, Phys.Rev. D85 (2012) 031504.
