corrfitter
----------

This directory contains code for manipulating correlators and other Monte
Carlo 'data' (eg, as in lattice QCD). The main module is:

corrfitter.py - Defines class CorrFitter for fitting the t dependence of
		2 and 3 point correlators, described by Corr2 and Corr3 respectively.

Information on how to install the library is in the file INSTALLATION.

Documentation on how to use this module is in doc/html/index.html or
online at <https://corrfitter.readthedocs.io>.

To test the module try 'make tests'.

The .py files in directory examples/ illustrate how to use corrfitter. See
the file examples/README for more information.

This module requires the lsqfit and gvar python packages.

Background information on the some of the fitting strategies used by
corrfitter can be found by doing a web searches for "hep-lat/0110175",
"arXiv:1111.1363", and :arXiv:1406.2279" (appendix). These are papers by
G.P. Lepage and collaborators whose published versions are:
    G.P. Lepage et al, Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 106 (2002) 12-20;
    K. Hornbostel et al, Phys.Rev. D85 (2012) 031504; and
    C.M. Bouchard et al, Phys.Rev. D90 (2014) 054506.

Versioning: Version numbers for corrfitter are now (v4.0 and later) based upon
*semantic  versioning* (http://semver.org). Incompatible changes will be
signaled by incrementing the major version number, where version numbers have
the form major.minor.patch. The minor number signals new features, and  the
patch number bug fixes.
