The test codes in the tst-corrfitter directory both test and illustrate 
corrfitter.py. The codes and what they illustrate are:

test-1.py	- Standard fit (Ds->etas), including error budget and plots
test-1m.py	- Marginalizing part of the fit function.
test-1b.py	- Bootstrap analysis.
test-1s.py	- Symmetric form factor (Ds->Ds)
test-1t.py	- Transposed form factors (Ds->etas and etas->D)
test-ups.py - 4x4 matrix fit (upsilon)

The makefile runs the tests ("make tests") and illustrates how to run the
individual scripts. The test-case output from each test is in the
corresponding .out file (test-1.out, test-1m.out, etc).
