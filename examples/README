The example codes in the examples directory illustrate corrfitter.py. The
codes and what they illustrate are:

test-1.py	- Standard fit (Ds->etas), including error budget and plots, eff_E()
test-1m.py	- Marginalizing part of the fit function.
test-1b.py	- Bootstrap analysis.
test-1s.py	- Symmetric form factor (Ds->Ds)
test-1t.py	- Transposed form factors (Ds->etas and etas->D)
test-antiperiodic.py - Fit involving antiperiodic correlator
test-ups.py - 4x4 matrix fit (upsilon)

The makefile runs the examples ("make run-all") and illustrates how to run
the individual scripts. The output from each example is in the
corresponding .out file (test-1.out, test-1m.out, etc).

The makefile script checks the output from each example against earlier
output; the two should agree (or be close to agreeing --- small differences
can result from roundoff error when using different hardware or software).

Each code has a flag TEST that is set to True by default. This puts the
code in a special "testing" mode. Changing TEST to False causes it to run
in a more standard mode.
