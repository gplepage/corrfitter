The example codes in the examples directory illustrate corrfitter.py. The
codes and what they illustrate are:

example.py  - Standard fit (Ds->ets); see "Annotated Example" in the documentation
test-1.py	- (Ds->etas) again, including error budget and plots, fastfit()
test-1m.py	- Marginalizing part of the fit function.
test-1b.py	- Bootstrap analysis.
test-1s.py	- Symmetric form factor (Ds->Ds)
test-1t.py	- Transposed form factors (Ds->etas and etas->D)
test-antiperiodic.py - Fit involving antiperiodic correlator
test-ups.py - 4x4 matrix fit (upsilon)

The makefile runs the examples ("make run") and illustrates how to run
the individual scripts. The output from each example is in the
corresponding .out file (test-1.out, test-1m.out, etc).

The makefile script checks the output from each example against earlier
output; the two should agree (or be close to agreeing --- small differences
can result from roundoff error when using different hardware or software).

Each code has a flag TEST that is set to True by default. This puts the
code in a special "testing" mode. Changing TEST to False causes it to run
in a more standard mode.
