The code in this directory is for fitting real Monte Carlo data from the HPQCD
collaboration (data is in the various .data and .h5 files). The examples are
discussed in the Annotated Examples section of the corrfitter documentation
(see doc/html/index.html).

Using  'make run' runs each script and compares its output with
output from earlier runs (in .out files). There may be slight differences
between runs on different hardware or with different software; these are
likely unimportant.
