The code in this directory is for fitting real Monte Carlo data from the HPQCD
collaboration (data is in the various .data files). The Python scripts
example.py, example-chained.py, and example-marginalize.py illustrate three
different ways to fit data,  and are referenced in the documentation: see the
section called  "Annotated Example".

The other sample scripts illustrate one fearture or another. Using  'make run-
examples' runs each script and compares its output with output from earlier
runs (in .out files). There may well be slight differences between runs on
different hardware or with different software; these are likely unimportant.
Each script has a flag TEST that is set to True by default. This puts the code
in a special "testing" mode. Changing TEST to False causes it to run in a more
standard mode.
