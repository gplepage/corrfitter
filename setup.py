    This module contains tools that facilitate least-squares fits, as functions
    of time ``t``, of simulation (or other statistical) data for 2-point and
    3-point correlators of the form::

        Gab(t)    =  <b(t) a(0)>
        Gavb(t,T) =  <b(T) V(t) a(0)>

    Each correlator is modeled using |Corr2| for 2-point correlators, or
    |Corr3| for 3-point correlators in terms of amplitudes for each source
    ``a``, sink ``b``, and vertex ``V``, and the energies associated with each
    intermediate state. The amplitudes and energies are adjusted in the
    least-squares fit to reproduce the data; they are specified in a shared prior
    (typically a dictionary).

    An object of type |CorrFitter| describes a collection of correlators and is
    used to fit multiple models to data simultaneously. Any number of
    correlators may be described and fit by a single |CorrFitter| object.
    |CorrFitter| objects can also be used to to extract the appropriate fit
    data from |Dataset| objects.
    
    This module has been used extensively for analyzing results from lattice
    QCD simulations.
