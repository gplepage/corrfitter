Introduction 
------------------
This module contains tools that facilitate least-squares fits, as functions
of time ``t``, of simulation (or other statistical) data for 2-point and
3-point correlators of the form::
        
    Gab(t)    =  <b(t) a(0)>
    Gavb(t,T) =  <b(T) V(t) a(0)>
        
where ``T > t > 0``. Each correlator is modeled using |Corr2| for 2-point
correlators, or |Corr3| for 3-point correlators in terms of amplitudes for
each source ``a``, sink ``b``, and vertex ``V``, and the energies
associated with each intermediate state. The amplitudes and energies are
adjusted in the least-squares fit to reproduce the data; they are defined
in a shared prior (typically a dictionary).
        
An object of type |CorrFitter| describes a collection of correlators and is
used to fit multiple models to data simultaneously. Fitting multiple
correlators simultaneously is important if there are statistical
correlations between the correlators. Any number of correlators may be
described and fit by a single |CorrFitter| object.

We now review the basic features of :mod:`corrfitter`. These features are also
illustrated in the context of a real application in an 
:ref:`annotated-example`, at the end.

Basic Fits
----------
To illustrate, consider data for two 2-point correlators: ``Gaa`` with the
same source and sink (``a``), and ``Gab`` which has source ``a`` and
(different) sink ``b``. The data are contained in a dictionary ``data``,
where ``data['Gaa']`` and ``data['Gab']`` are one-dimensional arrays
containing values for ``Gaa(t)`` and ``Gab(t)``, respectively, with
``t=0,1,2...63``. Each array element in ``data['Gaa']`` and ``data['Gab']``
is a Gaussian random variable of type |GVar|, and specifies the mean and
standard deviation for the corresponding data point::
        
    >>> print data['Gaa']
    [0.1597910(41) 0.0542088(31) ... ]
    >>> print data['Gab']
    [0.156145(18) 0.102335(15) ... ]
        
|GVar|\s can also capture any statistical correlations between different
pieces of data.
        
We want to fit this data to the following formulas::
        
    Gaa(t,N) = sum_i=0..N-1  a[i]**2 * exp(-E[i]*t)
    Gab(t,N) = sum_i=0..N-1  a[i]*b[i] * exp(-E[i]*t)
        
Our goal is to find values for the amplitudes, ``a[i]`` and ``b[i]``, and the
energies, ``E[i]``, so that these formulas reproduce the average values for
``Gaa(t,N)`` and ``Gab(t,N)`` that come from the data, to within the data's
statistical errors. We use the same ``a[i]``\s and ``E[i]``\s in both
formulas. The fit parameters used by the fitter are the ``a[i]``\s and
``b[i]``\s, as well as the differences ``dE[i]=E[i]-E[i-1]`` for ``i>0`` and
``dE[0]=E[0]``. The energy differences are usually positive by construction
(see below) and are easily converted back to energies using::
        
    E[i] = sum_j=0..i dE[j]
        
A typical code has the following structure::
        
    from corrfitter import CorrFitter
        
    data = make_data('mcfile')          # user-supplied routine
    models = make_models()              # user-supplied routine
    N = 4                               # number of terms in fit functions
    prior = make_prior(N)               # user-supplied routine
    fitter = CorrFitter(models=models)
    fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior)  # do the fit
    print_results(fit, prior, data)     # user-supplied routine
        
We discuss each user-supplied routine in turn.
        
a) make_data
____________________________
``make_data('mcfile')`` creates the dictionary containing the data that is to
be fit. Typically such data comes from a Monte Carlo simulation. Imagine that
the simulation creates a file called ``'mcfile'`` with layout ::
        
     # first correlator: each line has Gaa(t) for t=0,1,2...63
     Gaa  0.159774739530e+00 0.541793561501e-01 ...
     Gaa  0.159751906801e+00 0.542054488624e-01 ...
     Gaa  ...
     .
     .
     .
     # second correlator: each line has Gab(t) for t=0,1,2...63
     Gab  0.155764170032e+00 0.102268808986e+00 ...
     Gab  0.156248435021e+00 0.102341455176e+00 ...
     Gab  ...
     .
     .
     .
        
where each line is one Monte Carlo measurement for one or the other
correlator, as indicated by the tags at the start of each line. (Lines for
``Gab`` may be interspersed with lines for ``Gaa`` since every line has a
tag.) The data can be analyzed using the :mod:`gvar.dataset` module::
        
    import gvar as gv
        
    def make_data(filename):
        dset = gv.dataset.Dataset(filename)
        return gv.dataset.avg_data(dset)
        
This reads the data from file into a dataset object (type
:class:`gvar.dataset.Dataset`) and then computes averages for each
correlator and ``t``, together with a covariance matrix for the set of
averages. Thus ``data = make_data('mcfile')`` creates a dictionary where
``data['Gaa']`` is a 1-d array of |GVar|\s obtained by averaging over the
``Gaa`` data in the ``'mcfile'``, and ``data['Gab']`` is a similar array
for the ``Gab`` correlator.
        
b) make_models
____________________
``make_models()`` identifies which correlators in the fit data are to be fit,
and specifies theoretical models (that is, fit functions) for these
correlators::
        
    from corrfitter import Corr2
        
    def make_models():
        models = [ Corr2(datatag='Gaa', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
                        a='a', b='a', dE='dE'),
                        
                   Corr2(datatag='Gab', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
                        a='a', b='b', dE='dE')
                 ]
        return models
        
For each correlator, we specify: the key used in the input data dictionary
``data`` for that correlator (``datatag``); the values of ``t`` for which
results are given in the input data (``tdata``); the values of ``t`` to
keep for fits (``tfit``, here the same as the range in the input data, but
could be any subset); and fit-parameter labels for the source (``a``) and
sink (``b``) amplitudes, and for the intermediate energy-differences
(``dE``). Fit-parameter labels identify the parts of the prior,
discussed below, corresponding to the actual fit parameters (the labels are
dictionary keys). Here the two models, for ``Gaa`` and ``Gab``, are
identical except for the data tags and the sinks. ``make_models()`` returns
a list of models; the only parts of the input fit data that are fit are
those for which a model is specified in ``make_models()``.
        
Note that if there is data for ``Gba(t,N)`` in addition to ``Gab(t,N)``, and
``Gba = Gab``, then the (weighted) average of the two data sets will be
fit if ``models[1]`` is replace by::
        
    Corr2(datatag='Gab', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
         a=('a', None), b=('b', None), dE=('dE', None),
         othertags=['Gba'])
        
The additional argument ``othertags`` lists other data tags that correspond
to the same physical quantity; the data for all equivalent data tags is
averaged before fitting (using :func:`lsqfit.wavg`). Alternatively (and
equivalently) one could add a third ``Corr2`` to ``models`` for ``Gba``,
but it is more efficient to combine it with ``Gab`` in this way if they are
equivalent.
        
c) make_prior
_______________________
This routine defines the fit parameters that correspond to each fit-parameter
label used in ``make_models()`` above. It also assigns *a priori* values to
each parameter, expressed in terms of Gaussian random variables (|GVar|\s),
with a mean and standard deviation. The prior is built using class
:class:`gvar.BufferDict`::
        
    import gvar as gv
        
    def make_prior(N):
        prior = gvar.BufferDict()       # prior = {}  works too
        prior['a'] = [gv.gvar(0.1, 0.5) for i in range(N)]
        prior['b'] = [gv.gvar(1., 5.) for i in range(N)]
        prior['dE'] = [gv.gvar(0.25, 0.25) for i in range(N)]
        return prior
        
(:class:`gvar.BufferDict` can be replaced by an ordinary Python dictionary;
it is used here because it remembers the order in which the keys are added.)
``make_prior(N)`` associates arrays of ``N`` Gaussian random variables
(|GVar|\s) with each fit-parameter label, enough for ``N`` terms in the fit
function. These are the *a priori* values for the fit parameters, and they
can be retrieved using the label: setting ``prior=make_prior(N)``, for
example, implies that ``prior['a'][i]``, ``prior['b'][i]`` and
``prior['dE'][i]`` are the *a priori* values for ``a[i]``, ``b[i]`` and
``dE[i]`` in the fit functions (see above). The *a priori* value for each
``a[i]`` here is set to ``0.1±0.5``, while that for each ``b[i]`` is
``1±5``::
        
    >>> print prior['a']
    [0.10(50) 0.10(50) 0.10(50) 0.10(50)]
    >>> print prior['b']
    [1.0(5.0) 1.0(5.0) 1.0(5.0) 1.0(5.0)]
        
Similarly the *a priori* value for each energy difference is ``0.25±0.25``.
(See the :mod:`lsqfit` documentation for further information on priors.)
        

d) print_results
_________________________________
The actual fit is done by ``fit=fitter.lsqfit(...)``, which also prints out
a summary of the fit results (this output can be suppressed if desired).
Further results are reported by ``print_results(fit, prior, data)``: for
example, ::
        
    def print_results(fit, prior, data): 
        a = fit.p['a']                              # array of a[i]s
        b = fit.p['b']                              # array of b[i]s
        dE = fit.p['dE']                            # array of dE[i]s
        E = [sum(dE[:i+1]) for i in range(len(dE))] # array of E[i]s
        print 'Best fit values:
        print '     a[0] =',a[0]                
        print '     b[0] =',b[0]              
        print '     E[0] =',E[0]
        print 'b[0]/a[0] =',b[0]/a[0]
        outputs = {'E0':E[0], 'a0':a[0], 'b0':b[0], 'b0/a0':b[0]/a[0]}
        inputs = {'a'=prior['a'], 'b'=prior['b'], 'dE'=prior['dE'],
                  'data'=[data[k] for k in data])
        print fit.fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs)
        
The best-fit values from the fit are contained in ``fit.p`` and are accessed
using the labels defined in the prior and the |Corr2| models. Variables like
``a[0]`` and ``E[0]`` are |GVar| objects that contain means and standard
deviations, as well as information about any correlations that might exist
between different variables (which is relevant for computing functions of the
parameters, like ``b[0]/a[0]`` in this example). 
        
The last line of ``print_results(fit,prior,data)`` prints an error budget for
each of the best-fit results for ``a[0]``, ``b[0]``, ``E[0]`` and
``b[0]/a[0]``, which are identified in the print output by the labels
``'a0'``, ``'b0'``, ``'E0'`` and ``'b0/a0'``, respectively. The error for any
fit result comes from uncertainties in the inputs --- in particular, from the
fit data and the priors. The error budget breaks the total error for a
result down into the components coming from each source. Here the sources are
the *a priori* errors in the priors for the ``'a'`` amplitudes, the ``'b'``
amplitudes, and the ``'dE'`` energy differences, as well as the errors in
the fit data ``data``. These sources are labeled in the print output by
``'a'``, ``'b'``, ``'dE'``, and ``'data'``, respectively. (See the
:mod:`gvar`/:mod:`lsqfit` tutorial for further details on partial standard
deviations and :func:`gvar.fmt_errorbudget`.)
                
Plots of the fit data divided by the fit function, for each correlator, are
displayed by calling ``fitter.display_plots()`` provided the :mod:`matplotlib`
module is present.

.. _faster-fits:   
     
Faster Fits
-----------
Good fits often require fit functions with several exponentials and many
parameters. Such fits can be costly. One strategy that can speed things up is
to use fits with fewer terms to generate estimates for the most important
parameters. These estimates are then used as starting values for the full
fit. The smaller fit is usually faster, because it has fewer parameters, but
the fit is not adequate (because there are too few parameters). Fitting the
full fit function is usually faster given reasonable starting estimates, from
the smaller fit, for the most important parameters. Continuing with the
example from the previous section, the code ::
        
    data = make_data('mcfile')  
    fitter = CorrFitter(models=make_models())
    p0 = None
    for N in [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]:
        prior = make_prior(N)
        fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0)
        print_results(fit, prior, data)
        p0 = fit.pmean
            
does fits using fit functions with ``N=1...8`` terms. Parameter mean-values
``fit.pmean`` from the fit with ``N`` exponentials are used as starting values
``p0`` for the fit with ``N+1`` exponentials, hopefully reducing the time
required to find the best fit for ``N+1``.


.. _positive-parameters:

Faster Fits --- Postive Parameters
----------------------------------

Priors used in |CorrFitter| assign an *a priori* Gaussian/normal distribution
to each parameter. It is possible instead to assign a log-normal distribution,
which forces the corresponding parameter to be positive.  Consider, for 
example, energy parameters labeled by ``'dE'`` in the definition of a model
(*e.g.*, ``Corr2(dE='dE',...)``). To assign log-normal distributions to these
parameters, include their logarithms in the prior and label the logarithms 
with ``'logdE'`` or ``'log(dE)'``: for 
example, in ``make_prior(N)`` use ::

    prior['logdE'] = [gv.log(gv.gvar(0.25, 0.25)) for i in range(N)]

instead of ``prior['dE'] = [gv.gvar(0.25, 0.25) for i in range(N)]``. The
fitter then uses the logarithms as the fit parameters. The original  ``'dE'``
parameters are recovered (automatically) inside the fit function from
exponentials of the ``'logdE'`` fit parameters.

Using log-normal distributions where possible can significantly improve the
stability of a fit. This is because otherwise the fit function typically has
many symmetries that lead to large numbers of equivalent but different best
fits. For example, the fit functions ``Gaa(t,N)`` and ``Gab(t,N)`` above are
unchanged by exchanging ``a[i]``, ``b[i]`` and ``E[i]`` with ``a[j]``,
``b[j]`` and ``E[j]`` for any ``i`` and ``j``. We can remove this degeneracy
by using a log-normal distribution for the ``dE[i]``\s since this guarantees
that all ``dE[i]``\s are positive, and therefore that ``E[0],E[1],E[2]...``
are ordered (in decreasing order of importance to the fit at large ``t``).
        
Another symmetry of ``Gaa`` and ``Gab``, which leaves both fit functions
unchanged, is replacing ``a[i],b[i]`` by ``-a[i],-b[i]``. Yet another is to
add a new term to the fit functions with ``a[k],b[k],dE[k]`` where ``a[k]=0``
and the other two have arbitrary values. Both of these symmetries can be
removed by using a log-normal distribution for the ``a[i]`` priors, thereby
forcing all ``a[i]>0``.
        
The log-normal distributions for the ``a[i]`` and ``dE[i]`` are introduced
into the code example above by changing the corresponding labels in
``make_prior(N)``,  and taking logarithms of the corresponding prior values::
        
    import gvar as gv
        
    def make_models():                          # same as before
        models = [ Corr2(datatag='Gaa', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
                         a='a', b='a', dE='dE'),
                        
                   Corr2(datatag='Gab', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
                         a='a', b='b', dE='dE')
                 ]
        return models
        
    def make_prior(N):
        prior = gvar.BufferDict()               # prior = {}  works too
        prior['loga'] = [gv.log(gv.gvar(0.1, 0.5)) for i in range(N)]
        prior['b'] = [gv.gvar(1., 5.) for i in range(N)]
        prior['logdE'] = [gv.log(gv.gvar(0.25, 0.25)) for i in range(N)]
        return prior
        
This replaces the original fit parameters, ``a[i]`` and ``dE[i]``, by new fit
parameters, ``log(a[i])`` and ``log(dE[i])``. The *a priori* distributions for
the logarithms are Gaussian/normal, with priors of ``log(0.1±0.5)`` and
``log(0.25±0.25)`` for the ``log(a)``\s and ``log(dE)``\s respectively. 

Note that the labels are unchanged here in ``make_models()``. It is
unnecessary to change labels in the models; |CorrFitter| will automatically
connect the  modified terms in the prior with the appropriate terms in the
models. This allows one to switch back and forth between log-normal and normal
distributions without changing the models --- only the names in the prior
need be changed. |CorrFitter| also supports "sqrt-normal" distributions,
which are indicated by ``'sqrt'`` at the start of a parameter-name in the
prior; the actual parameter in the fit function is the square of this fit-
parameter, and so is again positive.

Note also that only a few lines in ``print_results(fit,prior,data)``, above,
would change had we used log-normal priors for ``a`` and ``dE``::

    ...
    a = fit.transformed_p['a'])                 # array of a[i]s
    ...
    dE = fit.transformed_p['dE']                # array of dE[i]s
    ...
    inputs = {'loga':prior['loga'], 'b':prior['b'], 'logdE':fit.prior['logdE'],
              'data':[data[k] for k in data]}
    ...

Here ``fit.transformed_p`` contains the best-fit parameter values from the
fitter, in addition to the exponentials of the ``'loga'`` and ``'logdE'``
parameters.

.. _marginalized-fits:

Faster Fits --- Marginalization
-------------------------------       
Often we care only about parameters in the leading term of the fit function,
or just a few of the leading terms. The non-leading terms are needed for a
good fit, but we are uninterested in the values of their parameters. In such
cases the non-leading terms can be absorbed into the fit data, leaving behind
only the leading terms to be fit (to the modified fit data) --- non-leading
parameters are, in effect, integrated out of the analysis, or *marginalized*.
The errors in the modified data are adjusted to account for uncertainties in
the marginalized terms, as specified by their priors. The resulting fit
function has many fewer parameters, and so the fit can be much faster.
        
Continuing with the example in :ref:`faster-fits`, imagine that ``Nmax=8``
terms are needed to get a good fit, but we only care about parameter values
for the first couple of terms. The code from that section can be modified to
fit only the leading ``N`` terms where ``N<Nmax``, while incorporating
(marginalizing) the remaining, non-leading terms as corrections to the data::
        
    Nmax = 8
    data = make_data('mcfile')  
    models = make_models()
    fitter = CorrFitter(models=make_models()) 
    prior = make_prior(Nmax)        # build priors for Nmax terms
    p0 = None
    for N in [1,2,3]:
        fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0, nterm=N) # fit N terms
        print_results(fit, prior, data)
        p0 = fit.pmean
        
Here the ``nterm`` parameter in ``fitter.lsqfit`` specifies how many terms are
used in the fit functions. The prior specifies ``Nmax`` terms in all, but only
parameters in ``nterm=N`` terms are varied in the fit. The remaining terms
specified by the prior are automatically incorporated into the fit data by
|CorrFitter|.
        
Remarkably this method is usually as accurate with ``N=1`` or ``2`` as a full
``Nmax``-term fit with the original fit data; but it is much faster. If this
is not the case, check for singular priors, where the mean is much smaller
than the standard deviation. These can lead to singularities in the covariance
matrix for the corrected fit data. Such priors are easily fixed: for example,
use ``gvar.gvar(0.1,1.)`` rather than ``gvar.gvar(0.0,1.)``. 
In some situations an *svd* cut (see below) can also
help.

.. _chained-fits:

Faster Fits --- Chained Fits
----------------------------
Large complicated fits, where lots of models and data are fit simultaneously,
can  take a very long time. This is especially true if there are strong
correlations in the data. Such correlations can also cause  problems from
numerical roundoff errors when the inverse of the data's covariance matrix is
computed for the ``chi**2`` function, requiring large *svd* cuts which can
degrade precision (see below). An alternative approach is to use *chained*
fits.  In a chained fit, each model is fit by itself in sequence, but with the
best-fit parameters from each fit serving as priors for fit parameters in  the
next fit. All parameters from one fit become fit parameters in the next,
including those parameters that are  not explicitly needed by the next fit
(since they may be correlated with the input data for the next fit or with its
priors). Statistical  correlations between data/priors from different models
are preserved  throughout (approximately).

The results from a chained fit are identical to a standard simultaneous fit in
the limit of large statistics (that is, in the Gaussian limit), but a  chained
fit never involves fitting more than a single correlator at a time. 
Single-correlator fits are usually much faster than simultaneous multi-correlator
fits, and roundoff errors (and therefore *svd* cuts) are much less of a 
problem. Consequently chained fits can be more accurate in practice than
conventional simultaneous fits, especially for high-statistics data.

Converting to chained fits is trivial: simply replace ``fitter.lsqfit(...)``
by ``fitter.chained_lsqfit(...)``. The output from this function represents
the results for the entire chain of fits, and so can be used in exactly the
same way as the  output from :func:`fitter.lsqfit` (and is usually quite
similar, to within statistical errors). Results from the different links in
the chain --- that is, from the fits for individual models --- can be accessed
after the fit using ``fitter.fit.fits[datatag]`` where ``datatag`` is the
data tag for the model of interest.

Setting parameter ``parallel=True`` in ``fitter.chained_lsqfit(...)`` makes the
fits for each model independent of each other. Each correlator is
fit separately, but nothing is passed from one fit to the next. In particular,
each fit uses the input prior. Parallel fits can be better than chained
fits in situations where different models share few or no parameters. 

It is sometimes useful to combine chained and parallel fits. This is done
by using a nested list of models. For example, setting ::

    models = [m1, m2, [m3a,m3b], m4]

with ``parallel=False`` (the default) in ``fitter.chained_lsqfit`` causes
the following chain of fits::

    m1 -> m2 -> (parallel fit of [m3a,m3b]) -> m4

Here the output from ``m1`` is used in the prior for fit ``m2``, and the
output from ``m2`` is used as the prior for a parallel fit of ``m3a``
and ``m3b`` together --- that is, ``m3a`` and ``m3b`` are not chained,
but rather are fit in parallel with each using a prior from fit ``m2``. The
result of the parallel fit of ``[m3a,m3b]`` is used as the prior for ``m4``.
Different levels of nesting in the list of 
models alternate between chained and parallel fits.

It is sometimes useful to follow a chained fit with an ordinary fit, 
but using the best-fit parameters from the chained fit as the prior for
the ordinary fit: for example, ::

        fit = fitter.chained_lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior) 
        fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=fit.p)

The second fit should,
in principle, have no effect on the results since it adds no new
information. In some cases, however, it polishes the results by making small
(compared to the errors) corrections that tighten up the overall fit. It is
generally fairly fast since the prior (``fit.p``) is relatively narrow. 
It is also possible to polish fits using ``fitter.chained_lsqfit``, with
parameters ``parallel=True`` and ``flat=True``, rather than using
``fitter.lsqfit``. This can be faster for very large fits.

      

Variations
----------
Any 2-point correlator can be turned into a periodic function of ``t`` by
specifying the period through parameter ``tp``. Doing so causes the 
replacement (for ``tp>0``) ::
        
    exp(-E[i]*t)   ->   exp(-E[i]*t) + exp(-E[i]*(tp-t))
        
in the fit function. If ``tp`` is negative, the function is replaced by 
an anti-periodic function with period ``abs(tp)`` and (for ``tp<0``)::
        
    exp(-E[i]*t)   ->   exp(-E[i]*t) - exp(-E[i]*(abs(tp)-t))
        
Also (or alternatively) oscillating terms can be added to the fit by
modifying parameter ``s`` and by specifying sources, sinks and energies for
the oscillating pieces. For example, one might want to replace the sum of
exponentials with two sums ::
        
    sum_i a[i]**2 * exp(-E[i]*t) - sum_i ao[i]**2 (-1)**t * exp(-Eo[i]*t)
        
in a (nonperiodic) fit function. Then an appropriate model
would be, for example, ::
        
    Corr2(datatag='Gaa', tdata=range(64), tfit=range(64),
          a=('a','ao'), b=('a','ao'), dE=('logdE','logdEo'), s=(1,-1))
        
where ``ao`` and ``dEo`` refer to additional fit parameters describing
the oscillating component. In general parameters for amplitudes and
energies can be tuples with two components: the first describing normal
states, and the second describing oscillating states. To omit one or the
other, put ``None`` in place of a label. Parameter ``s[0]`` is an overall
factor multiplying the non-oscillating terms, and ``s[1]`` is the
corresponding factor for the oscillating terms.
        
Highly correlated data can lead to problems from numerical roundoff errors,
particularly where the fit code inverts the covariance matrix when
constructing the ``chi**2`` function. Such problems show up as unexpectedly
large ``chi**2`` or fits that stall and appear never to converge. Such
situations are usually improved by introducing an *svd* cut: for example, ::

    fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0, svdcut=1e-4)

Introducing an *svd* cut increases the effective errors and so is a
conservative move. For more information about *svd* cuts see the :mod:`lsqfit`
tutorial and documentation. Parameters ``svdcut`` and ``svdnum`` are used to
specify an *svd* cut. (It is often useful to to set ``svdnum`` equal to the
number of measurements used to determine the covariance matrix for ``G(t)``
since that is the largest number of eigenmodes possible in the covariance
matrix.)


Very Fast (But Limited) Fits
-----------------------------
At large ``t``, correlators are dominated by the term with the smallest
``E``, and often it is only the parameters in that leading term that are
needed. In such cases there is a very fast analysis that is often almost
as accurate as a full fit. An example is::
    
    from corrfitter import fastfit
    
    data = make_data('mcfile')    # user-supplied routine - fit data
    N = 10                        # number of terms in fit functions
    prior = make_prior(N)         # user-supplied routine - fit prior
    model = Corr2(a=..., b=..., ...) # create model describing correlator
    fit = fastfit(data=data, prior=prior, model=model)
    print('E[0] =', fit.E)                  # E[0]
    print('a[0]*b[0] =', fit.ampl)          # a[0]*b[0]
    print('chi2/dof =', fit.chi2/fit.dof)   # good fit if of order 1 or less
    print('Q =', fit.Q)             # good fit if Q bigger than about 0.1
    
:class:`fastfit` estimates ``E[0]`` by using the prior, in effect, to
remove (*marginalize*) all terms from the correlator other than the
``E[0]`` term: so the data ``Gdata(t)`` for the correlator is replaced by,
for example, ::

    Gdata(t) - sum_i=1..N-1  a[i]*b[i] * exp(-E[i]*t)

where ``a[i]``, ``b[i]``, and ``E[i]`` for ``i>0`` are replaced by their
values in the prior. The modified prior is then fit by a single term,
``a[0] * b[0] * exp(-E[0]*t)``, which means that a fit is not necessary
(since the functional form is so simple). It is important to check the
``chi**2`` of the fit, to make sure the fit is good. If it is not, try
restricting ``model.tfit`` to larger ``t``\s (:class:`fastfit` averages
estimates from all ``t``\s in ``model.tfit``).
    
The marginalization of terms with larger ``E``\s allows the code to use
information from much smaller ``t``\s than otherwise, increasing precision.
It also quantifies the uncertainty caused by the existence of these terms.
This simple analysis is a special case of the more general marginalization
strategy discussed in :ref:`faster-fits`, above.
    
3-Point Correlators
-------------------
Correlators ``Gavb(t,T) = <b(T) V(t) a(0)>`` can also be included in fits
as functions of ``t``. In the illustration above, for example, we might
consider additional Monte Carlo data describing a form factor with the 
same intermediate states before and after ``V(t)``. Assuming the data is
tagged by ``aVbT15`` and describes ``T=15``, the corresponding entry in the
collection of models might then be::
    
    Corr3(datatag='aVbT15', T=15, tdata=range(16), tfit=range(16),
        Vnn='Vnn',                # parameters for V
        a='a', dEa='dE',          # parameters for a->V
        b='b', dEb='dE',          # parameters for V->b
        )
    
This models the Monte Carlo data for the 3-point function using the
following formula::
    
    sum_i,j a[i] * exp(-Ea[i]*t) * Vnn[i,j] * b[j] * exp(-Eb[j]*t)
    
where the ``Vnn[i,j]``\s are new fit parameters related to ``a->V->b`` form
factors. Obviously multiple values of ``T`` can be studied by including
multiple |Corr3| models, one for each value of ``T``. Either or both of the
initial and final states can have oscillating components (include ``sa``
and/or ``sb``), or can be periodic (include ``tpa`` and/or ``tpb``). If
there are oscillating states then additional ``V``\s must be specified:
``Vno`` connecting a normal state to an oscillating state, ``Von``
connecting oscillating to normal states, and ``Voo`` connecting oscillating
to oscillating states.
    
There are two cases that require special treatment. One is when
simultaneous fits are made to ``a->V->b`` and ``b->V->a``. Then the
``Vnn``, ``Vno``, *etc.* for ``b->V->a`` are the (matrix) transposes of
the the same matrices for ``a->V->b``. In this case the models for the two
would look something like::
    
    models = [ 
        ...
        Corr3(datatag='aVbT15', T=15, tdata=range(16), tfit=range(16),
            Vnn='Vnn', Vno='Vno', Von='Von', Voo='Voo',
            a=('a','ao'), dEa=('dE','dEo'), sa=(1,-1), # a->V
            b=('b','bo'), dEb=('dE','dEo'), sb=(1,-1)  # V->b
            ),
        Corr3(datatag='bVaT15', T=15, tdata=range(16), tfit=range(16),
            Vnn='Vnn', Vno='Vno', Von='Von', Voo='Voo', transpose_V=True,
            a=('b','bo'), dEa=('dE','dEo'), sa=(1,-1), # b->V
            b=('a','ao'), dEb=('dE','dEo'), sb=(1,-1)  # V->a
            ),
        ...
    ]
    
The same ``V``\s are specified for the second correlator, but setting
``transpose_V=True`` means that the transpose of each matrix is used
in the fit for that correlator.
    
The second special case is for fits to ``a->V->a`` where source and sink
are the same. In that case, ``Vnn`` and ``Voo`` are symmetric matrices, and
``Von`` is the transpose of ``Vno``. The model for such a case would look
like::
    
    Corr3(datatag='aVbT15', T=15, tdata=range(16), tfit=range(16),
        Vnn='Vnn', Vno='Vno', Von='Vno', Voo='Voo', symmetric_V=True,
        a=('a','ao'), dEa=('dE', 'dEo'), sa=(1, -1), # a->V
        b=('a','ao'), dEb=('dE', 'dEo'), sb=(1, -1)  # V->a
        )
    
Here ``Vno`` and ``Von`` are set equal to the same matrix, but specifying
``symmetric_V=True`` implies that the transpose will be used for ``Von``.
Furthermore ``Vnn`` and ``Voo`` are symmetric matrices when
``symmetric_V==True`` and so only the upper part of each matrix is needed.
In this case ``Vnn`` and ``Voo`` are treated as one-dimensional arrays with
``N(N+1)/2`` elements corresponding to the upper parts of each matrix,
where ``N`` is the number of exponentials (that is, the number of
``a[i]``\s).

Testing Fits with Simulated Data
-------------------------------- 
Large fits are complicated and often involve nontrivial choices about 
algorithms (*e.g.*, chained fits versus regular fits), priors, and
*svd* cuts --- choices that affect the values and errors for the fit 
parameters. In such situations it is often a good idea to test the 
fit protocol that has been selected. This can be done by fitting simulated
data. Simulated data looks almost identical to the original fit
data but has means that have been adjusted to correspond to fluctuations
around a correlator with known (before the fit) parameter values: ``p=pexact``. 
The |CorrFitter| iterator ``simulated_data_iter`` creates any number of
different simulated data sets of this kind. Fitting any of these with
a particular fit protocol tests the reliability of that protocol since
the fit results should agree with ``pexact`` 
to within the (simulated) fit's errors. One or two fit simulations of this
sort are usually enough to establish the validity of a protocol. It is also
easy to compare the performance of different fit options by applying these in
fits of simulated data, again because we know the correct answers (``pexact``)
ahead of time.

Typically one obtains reasonable values for ``pexact`` from a fit to the 
real data. Assuming these have been dumped into a file named ``"pexact_file"``
(using, for example, ``fit.dump_pmean("pexact_file")``), a testing script
might look something like::

    import gvar as gv
    import lsqfit 
    import corrfitter

    def main():
        dataset = gv.dataset.Dataset(...)       # from original fit code
        fitter = corrfitter.CorrFitter(         # from original fit code
            models = make_models(...),
            prior = make_prior(...), 
            ...
            )
        n = 2                                   # number of simulations
        pexact = lsqfit.nonlinear_fit.load_parameters("pexact_file")
        for sdata in fitter.simulated_data_iter(n, dataset, pexact=pexact):
            # sfit = fit to the simulated data sdata
            sfit = fitter.lsqfit(data=sdata, p0=pexact, prior=prior, svdcut=..., ...)
            ... check that sfit.p values agree with pexact to within sfit.psdev ...

Simulated fits provide an alternative to a *bootstrap analysis* (see next 
section). By collecting results from many simulated fits, one can test whether
or not fit results are distributed in Gaussian distributions around ``pexact``,
with widths that equal the standard deviations from the fit (``fit.psdev``
or ``sfit.psdev``).

Fit simulations are particularly useful for setting *svd* cuts. Given 
a set of approximate parameter values to use for ``pexact``, it is easy
to run fits with a range of *svd* cuts to see how small ``svdcut``
can be made before the parameters of interest deviate too far from ``pexact``.


Bootstrap Analyses
------------------
A *bootstrap analysis* gives more robust error estimates for fit parameters
and functions of fit parameters than the conventional fit when errors are
large, or fluctuations are non-Gaussian. A typical code looks something like::
    
    import gvar as gv
    import gvar.dataset as ds
    from corrfitter import CorrFitter
    # fit
    dset = ds.Dataset('mcfile')
    data = ds.avg_data(dset)            # create fit data
    fitter = Corrfitter(models=make_models())
    N = 4                               # number of terms in fit function
    prior = make_prior(N)
    fit = fitter.lsqfit(prior=prior, data=data)  # do standard fit
    print 'Fit results:'
    print 'a',exp(fit.p['loga'])        # fit results for 'a' amplitudes
    print 'dE',exp(fit.p['logdE'])      # fit results for 'dE' energies
    ...
    ...
    # bootstrap analysis
    print 'Bootstrap fit results:'
    nbootstrap = 10                     # number of bootstrap iterations
    bs_datalist = (ds.avg_data(d) for d in dset.bootstrap_iter(nbootstrap))
    bs = ds.Dataset()                   # bootstrap output stored in bs
    for bs_fit in fitter.bootstrap_iter(bs_datalist): # bs_fit = lsqfit output
        p = bs_fit.pmean    # best fit values for current bootstrap iteration
        bs.append('a', exp(p['loga']))  # collect bootstrap results for a[i]
        bs.append('dE', exp(p['logdE']))# collect results for dE[i]
        ...                             # include other functions of p 
        ...
    bs = ds.avg_data(bs, bstrap=True)   # medians + error estimate
    print 'a', bs['a']                  # bootstrap result for 'a' amplitudes
    print 'dE', bs['dE']                # bootstrap result for 'dE' energies
    ....
        
This code first prints out the standard fit results for the ``'a'`` amplitudes
and ``'dE'`` energies. It then makes ``10`` bootstrap copies of the original
input data, and fits each using the best-fit parameters from the original fit
as the starting point for the bootstrap fit. The variation in the best-fit
parameters from fit to fit is an indication of the uncertainty in those
parameters. This example uses a :class:`gvar.dataset.Dataset` object ``bs`` to
accumulate the results from each bootstrap fit, which are computed using the
best-fit values of the parameters (ignoring their standard deviations). Other
functions of the fit parameters could be included as well. At the end
``avg_data(bs, bstrap=True)`` finds median values for each quantity in
``bs``, as well as a robust estimate of the uncertainty (to within 30% since
``nbootstrap`` is only ``10``).
    
The list of bootstrap data sets ``bs_datalist`` can be omitted in this example
in situations where the input data has high statistics. Then the bootstrap
copies are generated internally by :func:`fitter.bootstrap_iter()` from the
means and covariance matrix of the input data (assuming Gaussian statistics).
    
    
Implementation
--------------
|CorrFitter| allows models to specify how many exponentials to include in the
fit function (using parameters ``nterm``, ``nterma`` and ``ntermb``). If that
number is less than the number of exponentials specified by the prior, the
extra terms are incorporated into the fit data before fitting. The default
procedure is to multiply the data by ``G(t,p,N)/G(t,p,max(N,Nmax))`` where:
``G(p,t,N)`` is the fit function with ``N`` terms for parameters ``p`` and
time ``t``; ``N`` is the number of exponentials specified in the models;
``Nmax`` is the number of exponentials specified in the prior; and here
parameters ``p`` are set equal to their values in the prior (correlated
|GVar|\s).
    
An alternative implementation for the data correction is to add
``G(t,p,N)-G(t,p,max(N,Nmax))`` to the data. This implementation is selected
when parameter ``ratio`` in |CorrFitter| is set to ``False``. Results are
similar to the other implementation.

Background information on the some of the fitting strategies used by
|corrfitter| can be found by doing web searches for "hep-lat/0110175" and
"arXiv:1111.1363". These are two papers by G.P. Lepage and collaborators 
whose published versions are: G.P. Lepage et al, Nucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 
106 (2002) 12-20; and K. Hornbostel et al, Phys.Rev. D85 (2012) 031504.


Correlator Model Objects
-------------------------
Correlator objects describe theoretical models that are fit to
correlator data by varying the models' parameters. 

A model object's parameters are specified through priors for the fit. A
model assigns labels to each of its parameters (or arrays of related
parameters), and these labels are used to identify the corresponding
parameters in the prior. Parameters can be shared by more than one model
object.

A model object also specifies the data that it is to model. The data is 
identified by the data tag that labels it in the input file or |Dataset|.

Annotated Example
----------------------------
In this section we describe a complete script that uses :mod:`corrfitter` to
extract energies, amplitudes, and transition matrix elements for  the
:math:`\eta_s` and :math:`D_s` mesons. The source code (``example.py``) and  
data file (``example.data``) are included with the :mod:`corrfitter`
distribution, in the ``examples/`` directory.

The ``main`` method follows the pattern described in :ref:`faster-fits`::

    from __future__ import print_function   # makes this work for python2 and 3

    import gvar as gv
    import numpy as np
    import collections
    from corrfitter import CorrFitter, Corr2, Corr3

    def main():
        data = make_data('example.data')          
        fitter = CorrFitter(models=make_models())
        p0 = None
        for N in [1, 2, 3, 4]:  
            print(30 * '=', 'nterm =', N)
            prior = make_prior(N)               
            fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0) 
            p0 = fit.pmean
        print_results(fit, prior, data) 
        fitter.display_plots()

The raw Monte Carlo data is in a file named ``'example.data'``. We are doing
four fits, with 1, 2, 3, and 4 terms in the fit function. Each fit starts its
minimization at point ``p0``, which is set equal to the mean values of the
best-fit parameters from the previous fit (``p0 = fit.pmean``). This reduces
the  number of iterations needed for convergence in the ``N = 4`` fit, for
example, from 217 to 23. It also makes multi-term fits more stable.

The last line displays plots of the fit data divided by the fit, provided 
:mod:`matplotlib` is installed. A plot is made for each correlator, and the
ratios should equal one to within errors. To 
move from one plot to the next press "n" on the keyboard; to move to a 
previous plot press "p"; to quit the plots press "q".

We now look at each other major routine in turn.

a) make_data
________________
Method ``make_data('example.data')`` reads in the Monte Carlo data, averages
it, and formats it for use by |CorrFitter|. The data file (``'example.data'``)
contains 225 lines,  each with 64 numbers on it, of the form::

    etas    0.3045088594E+00    0.7846334531E-01    0.3307295938E-01 ...
    etas    0.3058093438E+00    0.7949004688E-01    0.3344648906E-01 ...
    ...

Each of these lines is a single Monte Carlo estimate for the :math:`\eta_s` 
correlator on a lattice with 64 lattice points in the ``t`` direction; 
there are 225 Monte Carlo estimates in all. The same file also contains
225 lines describing the :math:`D_s` meson correlator::

    Ds    0.2303351094E+00    0.4445243750E-01    0.8941437344E-02 ...
    Ds    0.2306766563E+00    0.4460026875E-01    0.8991960781E-02 ...
    ...

And it contains 225 lines each giving the 3-point amplitude for 
:math:`\eta_s \to D_s`
where the source and sink are separated by 15 and 16 time steps on the
lattice::

    3ptT15    0.4679643906E-09    0.1079643844E-08    0.2422032031E-08 ...
    3ptT15    0.4927106406E-09    0.1162639109E-08    0.2596277812E-08 ...
    ...

    3ptT16     0.1420718453E-09    0.3205214219E-09    0.7382921875E-09 ...
    3ptT16     0.1501385469E-09    0.3478552344E-09    0.8107883594E-09 ...
    ...

The first, second, third, *etc.* lines for each label come from the first, 
second, third, *etc.* Monte Carlo iterations, respectively; this allows
the code to compute correlations between different 
types of data.

We use the tools in :mod:`gvar.dataset` designed for reading files in this
format::

    def make_data(datafile):
        """ Read data from datafile and average it. """
        return gv.dataset.avg_data(gv.dataset.Dataset(datafile))

This routine returns a dictionary whose keys are the strings used to label the
individual lines in ``example.data``: for example, ::

    >>> data = make_data('example.data')
    >>> print(data['Ds'])
    [0.2307150(73) 0.0446523(32) 0.0089923(15) ... 0.0446527(32)]
    >>> print(data['3ptT16'])
    [1.4583(21)e-10 3.3639(44)e-10 ... 0.000023155(30)]

Here each entry in ``data`` is an array of |GVar|\s representing the Monte
Carlo estimates (mean and covariance) for the corresponding correlator. This 
is the format needed by |CorrFitter|.

b) make_models
__________________
Method ``make_models()`` specifies the theoretical models that will be used 
to fit the data::

    def make_models():
        """ Create models to fit data. """
        tmin = 5
        tp = 64
        models = [
            Corr2(
                datatag='etas', 
                tp=tp,  tdata=range(tmin),  tfit=range(tmin, tp-tmin),  
                a='etas:a',  b='etas:a',  dE='etas:dE'
                ),  
                
            Corr2(
                datatag='Ds',
                tp=tp,  tdata=range(tmin),  tfit=range(tmin, tp-tmin),  
                a=('Ds:a', 'Ds:ao'), b=('Ds:a', 'Ds:ao'), 
                dE=('Ds:dE', 'Ds:dEo'), s=(1., -1.)
                ),

            Corr3(
                datatag='3ptT15', 
                tdata=range(16), T=15, tfit=range(tmin, 16-tmin), 
                a='etas:a', dEa='etas:dE', tpa=tp, 
                b=('Ds:a', 'Ds:ao'), dEb=('Ds:dE', 'Ds:dEo'), tpb=tp, sb=(1, -1.), 
                Vnn='Vnn', Vno='Vno'
                ), 
                
            Corr3(
                datatag='3ptT16', 
                tdata=range(17), T=16, tfit=range(tmin, 17-tmin), 
                a='etas:a', dEa='etas:dE', tpa=tp, 
                b=('Ds:a', 'Ds:ao'), dEb=('Ds:dE', 'Ds:dEo'), tpb=tp, sb=(1, -1.), 
                Vnn='Vnn', Vno='Vno'
                )
            ]
        return models

Four models are specified, one for each correlator to be fit. The first two
are for the :math:`\eta_s` and :math:`D_s` two-point correlators, corresponding to
entries in the data dictionary with keys ``'etas'`` and ``'Ds'``,
respectively. These are periodic propagators, with period 64 (``tp``), and we want to
omit the first and last 5 (``tmin``) time steps in the correlator. The
``t``\s to be fit are listed in ``tfit``, while the ``t``\s contained in the
data are in ``tdata``. Labels for the fit parameters corresponding to the
sources (and sinks) are specified for each, ``'etas:a'`` and ``'Ds:a'``, as
are labels for the energy differences, ``'etas:dE'`` and ``'Ds:dE'``.  The
:math:`D_s` propagator also has an oscillating piece because this data comes from
a staggered-quark analysis. Sources/sinks and energy differences are
specified for these as well: ``'Ds:ao'`` and ``'Ds:dEo'``.

Finally three-point models are specifies for the data corresponding to 
data-dictionary keys ``'3ptT15'`` and ``'3ptT16'``. These share several 
parameters with the two-point correlators, but introduce new parameters
for the transition elements: ``'Vnn'`` connecting normal states, and 
``'Vno'`` connecting normal states with oscillating states.

c) make_prior
_________________
Method ``make_prior(N)`` creates *a priori* estimates for each fit 
parameter, to be used as priors in the fitter::

    def make_prior(N):
        """ Create priors for fit parameters. """
        prior = gv.BufferDict()
        # etas
        metas = gv.gvar('0.4(2)')
        prior['log(etas:a)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.3(3)']))   
        prior['log(etas:dE)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.5(5)']))
        prior['log(etas:dE)'][0] = gv.log(metas)

        # Ds
        mDs = gv.gvar('1.2(2)')
        prior['log(Ds:a)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.3(3)']))
        prior['log(Ds:dE)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.5(5)']))
        prior['log(Ds:dE)'][0] = gv.log(mDs)

        # Ds -- oscillating part
        prior['log(Ds:ao)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.1(1)']))
        prior['log(Ds:dEo)'] = gv.log(gv.gvar(N * ['0.5(5)']))
        prior['log(Ds:dEo)'][0] = gv.log(mDs + gv.gvar('0.3(3)'))

        # V
        prior['Vnn'] = gv.gvar(N * [N * ['0(1)']])
        prior['Vno'] = gv.gvar(N * [N * ['0(1)']])

        return prior

Parameter ``N`` specifies how many terms are kept in the fit functions. The
priors are specified in a dictionary ``prior``. Each entry is an array, of
length ``N``, with one entry for each term. Each entry is a Gaussian random
variable, specified by an object of type  |GVar|. Here we use the fact that
``gvar.gvar()`` can make a list of |GVar|\s from a list of strings of the form
``'0.1(1)'``: for example, ::

    >>> print(gv.gvar(['1(2)', '3(2)']))
    [1.0(2.0) 3.0(2.0)]

In this particular fit, we can assume that all the sinks/sources
are positive, and we can require that the energy differences be positive. To
force positivity, we use log-normal distributions for these parameters by
defining priors for ``'log(etas:a)'``, ``'log(etas:dE)'``,... rather than
``'etas:a'``,  ``'etas:dE'``,... (see :ref:`positive-parameters`). The *a
priori* values for these fit parameters are the logarithms of the values for
the parameters themselves: for example, each ``etas:a'`` has prior ``0.3(3)``,
while the actual fit parameters, ``log(etas:a)``, have priors
``log(0.3(3)) = -1.2(1.0)``.

We override the default priors for the ground-state energies in each case.
This is not unusual since ``dE[0]``, unlike the other ``dE``\s,  is an energy,
not an energy difference. For the oscillating :math:`D_s` state, we require
that its mass be ``0.3(3)`` larger than the :math:`D_s` mass. One could  put
more precise information into the priors if that made sense given the goals
of the simulation. For example, if the main objective is a value for ``Vnn``,
one might include fairly exact information about the :math:`D_s` and
:math:`\eta_s` masses in the prior, using results from experiment or from 
earlier simulations. This would make no sense, however, if the goal is to 
verify that simulations gives correct masses.

Note, finally, that a statement like ::

    prior['Vnn'] = gv.gvar(N * [N* ['0(1)']])       # correct 

is *not* the same as ::

    prior['Vnn'] = N * [N * [gv.gvar('0(1)')]]      # wrong

The former creates ``N ** 2`` independent |GVar|\s, with one for each element
of ``Vnn``; it is one of the most succinct ways of creating a large number of
|GVar|\s. The latter creates only a single |GVar| and uses it repeatedly for
every element ``Vnn``, thereby forcing every element of ``Vnn``  to be equal
to every other element when fitting (since the difference between any two of
their priors is ``0±0``); it is almost certainly not what is desired.
Usually one wants to create the array of strings first, and then convert it to
|GVar|\s using ``gvar.gvar()``.

d) print_results
_____________________
Method ``print_results(fit, prior, data)`` reports on the best-fit values
for the fit parameters from the last fit::

    def print_results(fit, prior, data):
        print('Fit results:')
        p = fit.transformed_p                   # best-fit parameterss

        # etas
        E_etas = np.cumsum(p['etas:dE'])
        a_etas = p['etas:a'])
        print('  Eetas:', E_etas[:3])
        print('  aetas:', a_etas[:3])

        # Ds
        E_Ds = np.cumsum(p['Ds:dE'])
        a_Ds = p['Ds:a'])
        print('\n  EDs:', E_Ds[:3])
        print(  '  aDs:', a_Ds[:3])

        # Dso -- oscillating piece
        E_Dso = np.cumsum(p['Ds:dEo'])
        a_Dso = p['Ds:ao']
        print('\n  EDso:', E_Dso[:3])
        print(  '  aDso:', a_Dso[:3])

        # V
        Vnn = p['Vnn']
        Vno = p['Vno']
        print('\n  etas->V->Ds:', Vnn[0, 0])
        print('  etas->V->Dso:', Vno[0, 0])

        # error budget
        outputs = gv.BufferDict()
        outputs['metas'] = E_etas[0]
        outputs['mDs'] = E_Ds[0]
        outputs['mDso-mDs'] = E_Dso[0] - E_Ds[0]
        outputs['Vnn'] = Vnn[0, 0]
        outputs['Vno'] = Vno[0, 0]

        inputs = collections.OrderedDict()      # can use dict() instead
        inputs['statistics'] = data             # statistical errors in data
        inputs.update(prior)                    # all entries in prior
        inputs['svd'] = fit.svdcorrection       # svd cut (if present)

        print('\n' + gv.fmt_values(outputs))
        print(gv.fmt_errorbudget(outputs, inputs))

        print('\n')

The best-fit parameter values are stored in dictionary ``p=fit.transformed_p``,
as are the exponentials of the log-normal parameters.
We also turn energy differences into energies using :mod:`numpy`'s cummulative
sum function :func:`numpy.cumsum`. The final output is::

    Fit results:
      Eetas: [0.41619(12) 1.007(89) 1.43(34)]
      aetas: [0.21834(16) 0.170(74) 0.30(12)]

      EDs: [1.20166(16) 1.704(17) 2.29(20)]
      aDs: [0.21466(20) 0.275(20) 0.52(20)]

      EDso: [1.442(16) 1.65(11) 2.17(44)]
      aDso: [0.0634(90) 0.080(26) 0.116(93)]

      etas->V->Ds  = 0.76725(76)
      etas->V->Dso = -0.793(92)


Finally we  create an error budget for the :math:`\eta_s`
and :math:`D_s` masses, for the mass difference between the :math:`D_s` and its
opposite-parity partner, and for the ground-state transition amplitudes
``Vnn`` and ``Vno``. The quantities of interest are specified in dictionary
``outputs``. For the error budget, we need another dictionary, ``inputs``,
specifying various inputs to the calculation: the Monte Carlo data, the
priors, and the results from any *svd* cuts (none here). Each of these inputs
contributes to the errors in the final results, as detailed in the
error budget::

    Values:
                  metas: 0.41619(12)         
                    mDs: 1.20166(16)         
               mDso-mDs: 0.240(16)           
                    Vnn: 0.76725(76)         
                    Vno: -0.793(92)          

    Partial % Errors:
                             metas       mDs  mDso-mDs       Vnn       Vno

            log(etas:a):      0.00      0.00      0.11      0.01      0.39
           log(etas:dE):      0.00      0.00      0.06      0.01      0.38

                    Vnn:      0.00      0.00      0.58      0.03      1.03

The error budget shows, for example, that the largest sources of uncertainty
in every quantity are the statistical errors in the input data. 

e) Final Results
_________________
The output from running this code is as follows:

.. literalinclude:: example.out

Note:

- This is a relatively simple fit, taking only a couple of seconds on a 
  laptop.

- Fits with only one or two terms in the fit function are poor, with 
  ``chi2/dof``\s that are significantly larger than one.

- Fits with three terms work well, and adding futher terms has almost no 
  impact. The ``chi**2`` does not improve and parameters for the
  added terms differ little from their prior values (since the data are 
  not sufficiently accurate to add new information).

- Chained fits (see :ref:`chained-fits`) are used if ``fitter.lsqfit(...)`` 
  is replaced by ``fitter.chained_lsqfit(...)`` in ``main()``. The results
  are about the same: for example, ::

        Values:
                      metas: 0.41619(12)         
                        mDs: 1.20156(17)         
                   mDso-mDs: 0.2554(41)          
                        Vnn: 0.7676(12)          
                        Vno: -0.754(26)          

  We obtain more or less the same results, ::

        Values:
                      metas: 0.41619(11)         
                        mDs: 1.20156(15)         
                   mDso-mDs: 0.2576(27)          
                        Vnn: 0.76666(67)         
                        Vno: -0.747(15)          


  if we polish the final results from the chained fit using 
  a final call to ``fitter.lsqfit`` (see :ref:`chained-fits`)::

        fit = fitter.chained_lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0) 
        fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=fit.p, svdcut=1e-4)

  Another variation is to replace the last line (``return models``) 
  in ``make_models()`` by::

        return [models[:2]] + models[2:]

  This causes the two 2-point correlators (``models[:2]``) to be fit
  in parallel, which makes sense since they share no parameters.
  The result of the (parallel) fit of the 2-point correlators is used
  as a prior for the chained fits of the 3-point correlators (``models[2:]``).
  The fit results are mostly unchanged, although the polishing fit 
  is significantly faster (more than 2x) in this case::

        Values:
                      metas: 0.41620(11)         
                        mDs: 1.20154(15)         
                   mDso-mDs: 0.2557(29)          
                        Vnn: 0.76718(60)         
                        Vno: -0.746(15)          


- Marginalization (see :ref:`marginalized-fits`) can speed up fits like 
  this one. To use an 8-term fit function, while tuning parameters for only
  ``N`` terms, we change only four lines in the main program::

    def main():
        data = make_data('example.data')          
        models = make_models()   
        fitter = CorrFitter(models=make_models(), ratio=False)                  #1
        p0 = None
        for N in [1, 2]:                                                        #2
            print(30 * '=', 'nterm =', N)
            prior = make_prior(8)                                               #3
            fit = fitter.lsqfit(data=data, prior=prior, p0=p0, nterm=(N, N))    #4 
            p0 = fit.pmean
        print_results(fit, prior, data)  
        fitter.display_plots()

  The first modification (``#1``) is in the definition of ``fitter``, where we add
  an extra argument to tell |CorrFitter| what kind of marginalization 
  to use (that is, not the ratio method). The second modification (``#2``) 
  limits the
  fits to ``N=1,2``, because that is all that will be needed to get good
  values for the leading term.
  The third modification (``#3``) sets the prior to eight terms, no matter what value
  ``N`` has. The last (``#4``) tells ``fitter.lsqfit`` to fit parameters from 
  only the first ``N`` terms in the fit function; parts of the prior that are
  not being fit are incorporated (*marginalized*) into the fit data. The output 
  shows that
  results for the leading term have converged by ``N=2`` (and even ``N=1`` isn't
  so bad):

  .. literalinclude:: example-marginalize.out

- Test the code by adding ``test_fit(fitter, 'example.data')`` to the ``main`` 
  program, where::

    def test_fit(fitter, datafile):
        gv.ranseed((5339893179535759510, 4088224360017966188, 7597275990505476522))
        print('\nRandom seed:', gv.ranseed.seed)
        dataset = gv.dataset.Dataset(datafile)
        pexact = fitter.fit.pmean
        prior = fitter.fit.prior
        for sdata in fitter.simulated_data_iter(n=2, dataset=dataset, pexact=pexact):
            print('\n============================== simulation')
            sfit = fitter.lsqfit(data=sdata, prior=prior, p0=pexact)
            diff = []
            # check chi**2 for leading parameters
            for k in sfit.p: 
                diff.append(sfit.p[k].flat[0] - pexact[k].flat[0])
            print(
                'Leading parameter chi2/dof [dof] = %.2f' % 
                (gv.chi2(diff) / gv.chi2.dof),
                '[%d]' % gv.chi2.dof, 
                '  Q = %.1f' % gv.chi2.Q
                )

  This code does ``n=2`` simulations of the full fit, using the means of fit 
  results from the last fit done by ``fitter`` as ``pexact``. 
  The code prints out each fit,
  and for each it computes the ``chi**2`` of the difference between the leading
  parameters and ``pexact``. The output is:

  .. literalinclude:: example-test1.out

  This shows that the fit is working well, at least for the leading 
  parameter for each key. 

  Other options are easily checked. For example,
  only one line need be changed in ``test_fit`` in order to test 
  a marginalized fit::

    sfit = fitter.lsqfit(data=sdata, prior=prior, p0=pexact, nterm=(2,2))

  Running this code gives:

  .. literalinclude:: example-test2.out

  This is also fine and confirms that ``nterm=(2,2)`` marginalized fits 
  are a useful, faster substitute for full fits. Indeed the simulation 
  suggests that the marginalized fit is somewhat more accurate
  than the original fit for the oscillating-state parameters (``Vno``, 
  ``log(Ds:ao)``, ``log(Ds:dEo)`` --- compare the simulated results with
  the ``nterm=4`` results from the original fit, as these were used to
