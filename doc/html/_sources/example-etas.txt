Introduction
-------------
The simplest use of :mod:`corrfitter` is calculating the 
amplitude and energy of the ground state in a single 
two-point correlator. Here we analyze an |etas| propagator where the 
source and sink are the same. 

The one slightly non-obvious aspect of this fit is its use of
log-normal priors for the energy differences ``dE`` between successive
states in the correlator. As discussed in :ref:`positive-parameters`,
this choice imposes an order on the states in relation to the 
fit parameters by forcing all ``dE`` values to be positive.
Any such restriction helps stabilize a fit, improving both 
efficiency and the final results. 

Another design option that  helps stabilize the fit is to do a series of
fits, with increasing  number ``N`` of states in the fit function, where
the results  from the ``N-1`` fit are used by the fitter as the  starting
point (``p0``) for the ``N`` fit. The initial fits are bad, but this procedure
helps guide the fit parameters towards sensible values as the number of states
increases. See :ref:`faster-fits` for more discussion.

The source code (``etas.py``) and 
data file (``etas-Ds.data``) are included with the :mod:`corrfitter` 
distribution, in the ``examples/`` directory.
The data are from the HPQCD collaboration.


Code
------------------
Following the template outlined in :ref:`basic-fits`, the entire
code is:

.. literalinclude:: etas/etas.py
    :lines: 1-


Here the Monte Carlo data are read by ``make_data('etas-Ds.data')``  from file
``'etas-Ds.data'``. This file contains (among other things)  225 lines,  each
with 64 numbers, of the form::

    etas    0.305044    0.0789607   0.0331313 ...
    etas    0.306573    0.0802435   0.0340765 ...
    ...

Each line is a different Monte Carlo estimate of the |etas| 
correlator for t=0...63. The mean values and covariance matrix
are computed for the 64 elements of the correlator using 
:func:`gvar.dataset.avg_data`, and the result is stored in
``data['etas']``, which is an array of Gaussian random 
variables (objects of type :class:`gvar.GVar`).

A |CorrFitter| object, ``fitter``, is created for a single two-point
correlator from a list of models created by ``make_models()``. There
is only one model in the list because there is only one correlator.
It is a :class:`Corr2` object which specifies that: 
the key (``datatag``) for extracting the correlator from the data dictionary is
``'etas'``; the propagator is periodic with period 64; each correlator
contains data for t values ranging from 0 to 63; only values 
greater than or equal to 5 and less than 64-5 are fit; the 
source and sink amplitudes are the same and labeled by ``'a'`` in 
the prior; and the energy differences between successive states
are labeled ``'dE'`` in the prior.

Fits are tried with ``N`` states in the fit function, where ``N`` 
varies from 2 to 5. Usually ``N=2`` is too small, resulting in 
a poor fit. Here we will find that results have converged by 
``N=3``. 

A prior, containing *a priori* estimates for the fit parameters,
is contructed for each ``N`` by ``make_prior(N)``. The amplitude priors,
``prior['a'][i]``, 
are assumed to be 0±1, while the differences between successive
energies are taken to be, roughly, 0.5±0.5. These are broad priors,
based upon preliminary fits of the data.
We want to use log-normal 
statistics for the energy differences, to guarantee that 
they are positive (and the states ordered, in order of 
increasing energy), so we use ``prior['logdE']`` for 
the logarithms of the differences --- instead of
``prior['dE']`` for the differences themselves --- and take the logarithm
of the prior.

The fit is done by ``fitter.lsqfit()`` and 
``print_results(fit)`` prints results for the first two states after 
each fit (that is, for each ``N``). Note how results from
the fit to ``N`` terms is used as the starting point for the 
fit with ``N+1`` terms, via parameter ``p0``. As mentioned above,
this speeds up the larger fits and also helps to stabilize them.

Results
--------
The output from this fit code is:

.. literalinclude:: etas/etas.out
    :lines: 1-

These fits are very fast --- a small fraction of a second each on a laptop. 
Fit results converge by ``N=3`` states. The amplitudes and energy differences
for states above the first three are essentially identical to the prior 
values; the Monte Carlo data are not sufficiently accurate to add any new 
information about these levels. The fits for ``N>=3`` are excellent, with 
chi-square per degree of freedom (``chi2/dof``) of 0.68. There are only 
28 degrees of freedom here because the fitter, taking advantage of the 
periodicity, folded the data about the midpoint in ``t`` and averaged, 
before fitting. The ground state energy and amplitude are determined to 
a part in 1,000 or better.
