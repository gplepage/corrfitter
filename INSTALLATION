To install:

1. If not already installed, install the entire lsqfit system and the other 
	libraries needed for it. The lsqfit and corrfitter codes works for 
	Python 2.6 and 2.7 (but not for Python 3 or Python 2.5 or earlier).

2. Use 'make install' to copy the relevant files into your Python. The files
	are installed in a standard directory (that Python knows about) in the 
	user's space. (The path for directory used is given in site.USER_SITE
	from the site module in Python: eg, get it from the Python using
		python -c 'import site; print site.USER_SITE'
	)
	
	Alternatively 'make install-sys' will install the files in the appropriate
	system-level python directory, instead of a user directory. This requires
	superuser permission usually.
	
	Also standard distutils commands can be used instead of make and the 
	makefile: eg, python setup.py install --user
	
3. (Optional) Use 'make test-all' to run a series of tests that verify that 
	the major components of corrfitter and dataset are working.

4. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files and directories.

5. (Optional) Install matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) in
	order to use CorrFitter.display_plots() for plots of the fits.


Note: corrfitter uses Python's Distutils package and so one can use the 
related commands: eg, 'python setup.py install --user' instead of 
'make install'.
