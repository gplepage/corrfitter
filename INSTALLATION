To install:

1. If not already installed, install the entire lsqfit system and the other 
	libraries needed for it. The lsqfit and corrfitter codes work for 
	Python 2.6 and 2.7 and 3.2 (and later). Python 3 may run slightly faster
	than Python 2 now.

2. Use 'make install' to copy the relevant files into your Python. The 	
	files are installed in a standard directory (that Python knows about) in 
	the user's space. A list of the installed files is stored in the file
	files-corrfitter.python.
	
	Alternatively 'make install-sys' will install the files in the 
	appropriate system-level python directory, instead of a user directory. 
	This requires superuser permission usually.
	
	N.B. Distutils commands like 'python setup.py install --user' can be
	used instead of 'make install'.
	
	Note: use 'make install-dataset' if the old dataset.py is needed (for
	legacy code; use gvar.dataset for new code).
	
	Note: To install corrfitter for an alternative version of python, say
	python3 for example, use 'make PYTHON=python3 install'. Python's standard
	directories are structured in such a way that it is necessary to do a
	separate installation for each python version that will use corrfitter.
		
3. (Optional) Use 'make test-all' to run a series of tests that verify that 
	the major components of corrfitter and dataset are working. (These are not
	great tests because roundoff error can cause small changes to occur on
	different hardware, causing some tests to fail. So it is not uncommon for
	some of the tests to fail even if everything is alright --- the answers
	that come out will be close to the ones in the .out file.)

4. (Optional) Use 'make clean' to erase work files and directories.

5. (Optional) Install matplotlib (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/) in
	order to use CorrFitter.display_plots() for plots of the fits.


To uninstall:

1. 'make uninstall' (probably) uninstalls most of what was installed.
